The action plan envisages the reopening of airports and the reconnection of Cyprus with
other countries in two phases as follows:
PHASE A – 9 to 19 June 2020
PHASE B – 20 June 2020
Category A: Greece, Malta, Bulgaria, Norway, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Hungary, Israel, Denmark, Germany, Slovakia, Lithuania.
Category B: Switzerland, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Estonia, Czech Republic.
In Phase A, those coming from countries of both categories must present a laboratory test certificate from an approved laboratory showing a negative result, in order to be allowed to board their flight, with the test having taken place 72 hours prior to departure.
Cypriot citizens and permanent residents of Cyprus may alternatively undergo the laboratory testing upon their arrival in Cyprus. In this case and until the announcement of the result, they shall remain in self-isolation at home.
In Phase B, which begins on 20 June, passengers coming from countries included in category A will not be required to bring a laboratory test certificate.
For passengers coming from countries included in category B, the same requirement shall apply as for all passengers in the first phase. That is, they have to present a laboratory test certificate from an approved laboratory showing a negative result in order to be allowed to
board their flight, with the test having taken place 72hours prior to departure.

For countries not included in the two phases at any given moment, flights to the Republic of Cyprus will be allowed only with passengers who are Cypriot citizens, permanent residents of Cyprus and persons issued with a special permit.
In these cases, the presentation of a laboratory test certificate from an approved laboratory will be required with a negative result and the examination having taken place 72 hours prior to departure. Alternatively, the test may take place at arrival in Cyprus. In this case, the passengers shall remain at a designated place for 1 day or until the announcement of the result.
