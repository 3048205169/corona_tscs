Remote classes and home learning

Teachers and university lecturers can send their pupils and students materials to work from home. All this so that the coronavirus does not affect the implementation of educational programs.

Schools

A break in the functioning of the school does not mean days off from school. Read your favorite book, fill in your knowledge or develop your competences. Use the free epodreczniki.pl platform and materials recommended by your teacher.
More information: https://epodreczniki.pl/  

Colleges

Classes at universities can be carried out remotely. In addition, scientists, doctoral students or prospective doctoral students may conduct research activities. Suspension of classes does not limit the conduct of research.

What is Coronavirus?

The new SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus causes a disease called COVID-19. The disease is most often manifested by fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches and fatigue.
How common are symptoms?

The severe course of the disease is observed in about 15-20% of people. Deaths occur in 2-3% of sick people. Probably these data are overestimated, because in many people with a mild course of the infection, laboratory confirmation has not been made.
Who is most at risk?

The most vulnerable to severe disease and death are elderly, immunocompromised people accompanied by other diseases, especially chronic ones.
How to protect yourself against the coronavirus?

The virus is spread by airborne droplets. There is currently no vaccine against the new coronavirus. However, other methods of preventing infection, as outlined below, can be used. These methods are also used in the prevention of other diseases transmitted by airborne droplets, such as seasonal flu (where the peak incidence is between January and March each year).
Where have coronavirus infections been reported so far?

The highest number of confirmed cases of infection with the new coronavirus was registered in China (99%), mainly in Hubei province. The remaining people ""dragged"" the virus to other countries in Asia, Europe, Oceania and North America and infected other people (eg in Germany, France, Great Britain).""",2020-02-28,2020-02-28,2022-05-19,The policy has an unlimited time span (e.g. recommendation to wash one's hands; passing of a legal bill),Poland,POL,PL,National,1,,,,Public Awareness Measures,Disseminating information related to COVID-19 to the public that is reliable and factually accurate,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Poland,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),No special population targeted,,,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,National Government,27.6988837542709,21.6807433939598,16.3764411630353,70,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_09zhdCqulhQoNgZ,http://web.archive.org/web/20200313025749/https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/informacje,2022-04-12,2022-04-12T13:03:10Z,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,62,28.6,1,1.44043707847595,0.548431634902954,0,60,37974826,601720558485.059,4.93766324502775,17.4524340244738,27.1230589859233,2,2,1.66554456179387,4.8835145664111,619403
