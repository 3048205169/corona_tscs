A regional approach to travel guides is being introduced today in the EU and Schengen countries, as well as the United Kingdom.  At the same time, the health authorities' new main recommendation enters into force. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs updates the travel guides for the EU and the Schengen countries as well as the United Kingdom on a weekly basis on the basis of the latest infection figures from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control  ECDC . For those countries that provide regional test data to ECDC, it will be possible to open for travel to low-risk regions in quarantine countries. Travel to high-risk regions in open countries may also be discouraged. In addition, all unnecessary travel to countries with significant entry restrictions is discouraged for travelers from Denmark.

Effective June 27, EU and Schengen countries will be categorized as either open/yellow (åbent) or quarantine country/orange (karantæneland) depending on its level of coronavirus spread. 
To be categorized as yellow, the country needs to report a level of under 20 infected citizens/ 100 000 citizens. 
An orange is those that report a level of 30 infected citizens /100 000 citizens or higher, and for travelers entering Denmark from a quarantine country, the Danish authorities strongly encourage a self-isolation period of 14 days. 
The list of orange countries will be updated on a weekly basis as of June 27 2020. UPDATE: As of December 12 2020, Danish authorities will provide travelers with more detailed travel restrictions/recommendations as regions inside an orange/yellow country can be classified as low vs high risk, which in practice thus allows traveling to yellow regions in orange countries.
The recommendations for travelers returning/entering Denmark from an orange country or region has also changed, from 14 days to 10 days of self-isolation, which can be ended at the 5th day on providing a negative Covid-19 test result.",2020-06-18,2020-12-12,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,Denmark,DNK,DK,National,0,,,,Quarantine,Self-Quarantine (i.e. quarantine at home),,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",No,"Austria,Belgium,Bulgaria,Croatia,Cyprus,Czechia,Denmark,Estonia,Finland,France,Germany,Greece,Hungary,Ireland,Italy,Latvia,Lithuania,Luxembourg,Malta,Netherlands,Poland,Portugal,Romania,Slovakia,Slovenia,Spain,Sweden,United Kingdom,Austria,Belgium,Czech Republic,Denmark,Estonia,Finland,France,Germany,Greece,Hungary,Iceland,Italy,Latvia,Liechtenstein,Lithuania,Luxembourg,Malta,Netherlands,Norway,Poland,Portugal,Slovakia,Slovenia,Spain,Sweden,Switzerland,United Kingdom",One or more regional groupings,"European Union (with the UK),Schengen Area (with the UK)",,,,,All Travelers (Citizen Travelers + Foreign Travelers ),No special population targeted,Inbound,All kinds of transport,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health,Ministry/Department of Foreign Affairs",,,,,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_10ZNiQyiV9To0tU ; https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_1gFHCuaDZxQlYqK,NA ; https://um.dk/da/nyheder-fra-udenrigsministeriet/newsdisplaypage/?newsID=D2878662-B264-41C0-A286-EE027C8C17F7 ; https://um.dk/da/nyheder-fra-udenrigsministeriet/newsdisplaypage/?newsID=069B7117-AB0A-4E4D-99C5-ABAF9081C84D,2021-09-17,2021-09-17T12:50:21Z,107660,935,78760,85552,8522829,1455.839,,,0,,0,3,8.13,2,0.561379015445709,-1.05005657672882,0,9.39208,5797446,370302958452.244,2.39132968541817,15.5729280337088,26.6375873141731,2,2,2.51790072975894,-0.685171818257238,722878
