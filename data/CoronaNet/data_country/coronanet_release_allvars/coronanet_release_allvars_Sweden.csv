Seasonal workers in the forestry, agricultural and horticulture sectors are now considered essential workers and are thus exempted from the entry ban. The government also explicitly made it clear that family members of Swedish citizens are exempt from the entry ban. The modified entry ban goes into effect on June 8th, 2020, and is planned to last until June 15th, 2020. 

The entry ban does not apply to Swedish nationals and exempts travellers from outside the EEA and Switzerland if they are travelling in order to return home and fulfill at least one of the following criteria:
1)  They are EEA or Swiss citizens or family members of an EEA or Swiss citizen
2) They are holders of a long-term residence status in Sweden or an EU member state, or a permanent or temporary residance permit in Sweden or an EEA state.
3)  They are Swedish national visa holders.
4) They have important reasons to travel into Sweden. This includes for example seasonal workers in the forestry, agricultural and horticulture sectors, diplomats, people in need of asylum, essential workers in the healthcare, or transport sector. Those who have emergency family reasons such as family reunification with Swedish citizens will also be exempt. 
 UPDATE: From July 4th, 2020, the Swedish government adjusted the entry ban of non-EEA citizens into Sweden by exempting several countries from the ban and allowing EU citizens to travel into Sweden from outside the EU regardlesss of the purpose of the trip.",2020-07-01,2020-07-03,2020-07-03,The policy has a clear end date,Sweden,SWE,SE,National,0,,,,External Border Restrictions,Total border crossing ban,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",No,"Afghanistan,Albania,Algeria,Andorra,Angola,Antigua and Barbuda,Argentina,Armenia,Australia,Azerbaijan,Bahamas,Bahrain,Bangladesh,Barbados,Belarus,Belize,Benin,Bhutan,Bolivia,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Botswana,Brazil,Brunei,Burkina Faso,Burundi,Cabo Verde,Cambodia,Cameroon,Canada,Central African Republic,Chad,Chile,China,Colombia,Comoros,Costa Rica,Cuba,Democratic Republic of the Congo,Djibouti,Dominica,Dominican Republic,Ecuador,Egypt,El Salvador,Equatorial Guinea,Eritrea,Eswatini,Ethiopia,Fiji,Gabon,Gambia,Georgia,Ghana,Grenada,Guatemala,Guinea,Guinea-Bissau,Guyana,Haiti,Honduras,Hong Kong,India,Indonesia,Iran,Iraq,Israel,Ivory Coast,Jamaica,Japan,Jordan,Kazakhstan,Kenya,Kiribati,Kosovo,Kuwait,Kyrgyzstan,Laos,Lebanon,Lesotho,Liberia,Libya,Macau,Madagascar,Malawi,Malaysia,Maldives,Mali,Marshall Islands,Mauritania,Mauritius,Mexico,Micronesia,Moldova,Monaco,Mongolia,Montenegro,Morocco,Mozambique,Myanmar,Namibia,Nauru,Nepal,New Zealand,Nicaragua,Niger,Nigeria,North Korea,North Macedonia,Northern Cyprus,Oman,Pakistan,Palau,Palestine,Panama,Papua New Guinea,Paraguay,Peru,Philippines,Qatar,Republic of the Congo,Russia,Rwanda,Saint Kitts and Nevis,Saint Lucia,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,Samoa,San Marino,Sao Tome and Principe,Saudi Arabia,Senegal,Serbia,Seychelles,Sierra Leone,Singapore,Solomon Islands,Somalia,South Africa,South Korea,South Sudan,Sri Lanka,Sudan,Suriname,Syria,Taiwan,Tajikistan,Tanzania,Thailand,Timor Leste,Togo,Tonga,Trinidad and Tobago,Tunisia,Turkey,Turkmenistan,Tuvalu,Uganda,Ukraine,United Arab Emirates,United Kingdom,United States,Uruguay,Uzbekistan,Vanuatu,Vatican,Venezuela,Vietnam,Yemen,Zambia,Zimbabwe","One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,Foreign Travelers,No special population targeted,Inbound,All kinds of transport,"Mandatory with Exceptions (Please list exceptions in the text entry),Mandatory (Other; please list other enforcement mechanisms in the text entry)",Ministry/Department of Foreign Affairs,59.0017327755076,56.7432797787795,54.4429631118944,57,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_21tS3WhWltpMhlB ; https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_Xh4deylqVsgkULf,NA ; https://www.lagboken.se/Lagboken/start/sfs/sfs/2020/700-799/d_4015088-sfs-2020_714-forordning-om-dels-fortsatt-giltighet-av-forordningen-2020_127-om-tillfalligt,2022-03-09,2022-03-09T10:08:13Z,69996,5420,0,11789,58945,5.802,,,,,,4,9.25,2,0.41813737154007,0.309990167617798,0,85,10183175,589823541463.317,2.22523861239767,16.1362474065114,27.1030892468466,2,2,2.49917945942907,4.66464682875734,2005210
