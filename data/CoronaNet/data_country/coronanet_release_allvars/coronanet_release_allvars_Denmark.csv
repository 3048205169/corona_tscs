Effective June 27, EU and Schengen countries will be categorized as either open/yellow (åbent) or quarantine country/orange (karantæneland) depending on its level of coronavirus spread. 
To be categorized as yellow, the country needs to report a level of under 20 infected citizens/ 100 000 citizens. 
An orange is those that report a level of 30 infected citizens /100 000 citizens or higher, and for travelers entering Denmark from a quarantine country, the Danish authorities strongly encourage a self-isolation period of 14 days. 
The list of orange countries will be updated on a weekly basis as of June 27 2020. UPDATE: As of December 12 2020, Danish authorities will provide travelers with more detailed travel restrictions/recommendations as regions inside an orange/yellow country can be classified as low vs high risk, which in practice thus allows traveling to yellow regions in orange countries.
The recommendations for travelers returning/entering Denmark from an orange country or region has also changed, from 14 days to 10 days of self-isolation, which can be ended at the 5th day on providing a negative Covid-19 test result.",2020-06-18,2020-12-12,,The policy’s end date is unknown or unreported,Denmark,DNK,DK,National,0,,,,Quarantine,Self-Quarantine (i.e. quarantine at home),,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",No,"Austria,Belgium,Bulgaria,Croatia,Cyprus,Czechia,Denmark,Estonia,Finland,France,Germany,Greece,Hungary,Ireland,Italy,Latvia,Lithuania,Luxembourg,Malta,Netherlands,Poland,Portugal,Romania,Slovakia,Slovenia,Spain,Sweden,United Kingdom,Austria,Belgium,Czech Republic,Denmark,Estonia,Finland,France,Germany,Greece,Hungary,Iceland,Italy,Latvia,Liechtenstein,Lithuania,Luxembourg,Malta,Netherlands,Norway,Poland,Portugal,Slovakia,Slovenia,Spain,Sweden,Switzerland,United Kingdom",One or more regional groupings,"European Union (with the UK),Schengen Area (with the UK)",,,,,All Travelers (Citizen Travelers + Foreign Travelers ),No special population targeted,Inbound,All kinds of transport,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health,Ministry/Department of Foreign Affairs",,,,,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_10ZNiQyiV9To0tU ; https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_1gFHCuaDZxQlYqK,NA ; https://um.dk/da/nyheder-fra-udenrigsministeriet/newsdisplaypage/?newsID=D2878662-B264-41C0-A286-EE027C8C17F7 ; https://um.dk/da/nyheder-fra-udenrigsministeriet/newsdisplaypage/?newsID=069B7117-AB0A-4E4D-99C5-ABAF9081C84D,2021-09-17,2021-09-17T12:50:21Z,107660,935,78760,85944,8553088,1471.296,,,0,,0,3,8.13,2,0.561379015445709,-1.05005657672882,0,9.39208,5797446,370302958452.244,2.39132968541817,15.5729280337088,26.6375873141731,2,2,2.51790072975894,-0.685171818257238,722878
