The National Government classifies countries into different categories. Hungarian citizens and family members of Hungarian citizens who are not Hungarian citizens entering Hungary from a green country may enter Hungary without any restrictions. The same individuals entering Hungary from a red or yellow country shall be subject to a medical examination upon arrival. Non-Hungarian citizens arriving from a green country may enter Hungary without any restrictions. Non-Hungarian citizens arriving from a yellow country shall be subject to a medical examination upon arrival. If the health examination reveals a suspicion of infection, individuals shall not be allowed to enter the territory of Hungary. Depending on the result of the medical examination, individuals may be placed in quarantine for 14 days. They need not be quarantined if submitting a negative PCR test result prior to entry. Non-Hungarian citizens arriving from a red country may not enter Hungary.
The list of countries classified as green, yellow or red can be found in the document ""Közlemény a COVID-19..."".
Various exceptions to these provisions exist. Those who may be exempted for reasons such as attendance at family events have to undergo an application procedure where they can prove their purpose of entry.
