R_00Ywy9bc9QLHyeJFs,8056246,update,original,Change of Policy,Relaxing,"On 13th March 2020, the Swiss Canton of Neuchâtel created 7 triage centers to sort suspect patients depending on the seriousness of their symptoms, and decide whether or not they should get tested. Based on several health checks conducted at the centers (fever checks, blood pressure, oxygen saturation tests...), patients are either sent to the hospital or back home. An 8th center managed by Médecins du Monde has also been created to welcome undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers. A telephone line has been opened to book appointments at the centers. This policy overall aims at relieving the congestion in hospitals. On 15th April 2020, the canton of Neuchâtel reduced the number of triage centers from 8 to 5 in order to match the demand and the resources.

   Normally, patients receiving heroin- or diacetylmorphine-assisted treatment must visit treatment centers at least once a day to receive their drug. However, given the risks of contagion, a pragmatic approach has been used temporarily since the beginning of the pandemic. This has involved increasing the interval between consultations, with good results.
   The Federal Council has decided to formalize this practice and anchor it in law. The amendment will remain in force until December 31, 2021.

Employers have a duty to allow staff at especially high risk to work from home, if necessary by allowing them to perform appropriate alternative tasks. If it is imperative for an employee to be physically present, the employer must take steps to protect that person by adapting procedures or the working environment. If it is not possible for the person to work at home or at the workplace, the employer must place the employee on leave while continuing to pay their wages. Those risk factors issued by the FOPH are still: above 65 years of age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, an immune system weakened by disease or treatment, or cancer.

The suspension does not apply to proceedings in which the public filing has expired and for which a conciliation session need not be held. In concrete terms, this implies, for example, that the time limit for lodging opposition to a construction project is suspended, since it is not advisable to consult plans with the municipal administration.
