As of tomorrow, 29. August, the police will restrict late-night alcohol sales in Harjumaa. By order of the head of the North prefecture, retail sale of alcoholic beverages will be restricted in Harju County from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. The restriction will remain in force until further notice, but it is currently estimated to be a short-term restriction, the duration of which depends on the attitude and behaviour of people and their compliance with the requirement of dispersion. The Police and Border Guard Board and the Health Board will re-evaluate the relevance of the restriction once a week.

âAccording to the Health Board, in Estonia, the risk for the spread of the infection is the highest in Tallinn due to large population and high population density.
