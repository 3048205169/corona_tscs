Based on the available scientific data on novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, elderly people as   well as individuals of any age with underlying chronic diseases (e.g. chronic respiratory   conditions, malignancies, etc), belong to groups that are in high-risk of developing a severe   condition and complications.  Therefore, people in high risk groups must systematically implement all measures for   preventing the transmission and spread of the novel coronavirus. If you belong to a high-risk   group, you should do the following:  ? Avoid contact with persons who show signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection.  ? Avoid all unnecessary travels, particularly to areas or countries with confirmed virus   spread in the community.  ? Implement hand hygiene and avoid touching your own face with your hands (eyes,   nose, mouth)  ? Adhere to chronic medication regimen (if available) and to your doctors’ advice.  ? Avoid gatherings and events, unless necessary.  ? Contact your doctor immediately in case you develop symptoms of respiratory   infection; seek medical evaluation.  ?
