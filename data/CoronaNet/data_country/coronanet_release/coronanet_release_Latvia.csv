To date, none of the vaccine manufacturers who have reported on their vaccine research have registered Covid-19 vaccines. However, the Ministry of Health and the responsible authorities are preparing for the vaccine to be registered and available. To date, the National Health Service has entered into vaccine supply agreements with four vaccine manufacturers - AstraZeneca , Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) , BioNTech / Pfizer , CureVac . The need to contract with several vaccine manufacturers is due to the fact that it is currently not possible to predict whether the registration process for all vaccines will be successful. It is also not possible to determine which vaccines will be the most effective, efficient and safe, and it is not known exactly which vaccines will be available the fastest. The volume of vaccines offered by the four vaccine manufacturers could provide an opportunity to vaccinate approximately one million Latvians.

The European Commission recommends that, depending on the situation in each country, priority groups for people to be vaccinated could be considered.

If the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends that the vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer be registered on Monday, 21 December, the European Commission (EC) will decide in a few days to grant a marketing authorization valid in all EU and EEA countries. After that, the vaccine can be delivered to all European Union countries at the same time, including Latvia. Thus, on December 28, 10 vaccination offices will start operating in Latvia, where medical staff working with COVID-19 patients and employees of the Emergency Medical Service (NMPD) will be able to receive the vaccine.

All of these dates are subject to change as neither the ESA nor the EC has officially confirmed these dates. Minister of Health Ilze Hänķele emphasizes: “Starting vaccination is not a race for speed. Our priority is to make sure that everyone involved is knowledgeable and ready to go. Let me remind you that there is some information that EU countries will only receive when the ESA recommends that a vaccine be registered. At the same time, we have made every effort to ensure that the Latvian side is ready to receive the vaccine, organize its distribution and offer it to the first group in society, which is currently the most vulnerable - doctors working with COVID-19 patients and NMPD staff. ”

This page was last updated on January 28, 2021

It is planned to vaccinate up to 70% of the Latvian population by the end of the summer, according to the informative report of the Ministry of Health ""On the Covid-19 vaccination plan"", which was heard today by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Minister of Health Daniels Pavļuts: “The vaccination plan we approved in government today is detailed, digital and flexible. Uncertainty is the only certainty of the time, now we will be ready to act in different situations. Both when there is a delay in the supply of vaccines and when there are a lot of them. ”

The updated vaccination plan is designed to make optimal use of the resources of the vaccination system and to implement a convenient and flexible vaccination process. The plan sets out a number of basic principles:

    the establishment of common lists of vaccinees, which will make it possible to maintain contact between those who have expressed an interest in vaccination and the location of the population in the priority group, as well as vaccination sites,
    the creation of a common calendar and queue to help plan the workload and opening hours of vaccination points and the management of records,
    centralized supply of vaccines and stockpile management,
    unified communication with the population.

It is currently planned that a total of more than 800 000 people could be provided with a state-paid vaccine. This number could be higher if the vaccine manufacturers approve Latvia's order.

So far, the National Health Service has entered into an agreement on the supply of vaccines with two vaccine manufacturers — AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen). The Minister for Health Ilze Viņķele said that €1.6 million has been paid upfront s so that Latvia can receive these vaccines.

It is likely that there will also be an agreement with another potential manufacturer, Pfizer, and altogether there are 7-8 producers in the ministry's lists.

“Latvia will do everything to make vaccines available,” the minister said.

The Ministry currently forecasts that, following a positive development scenario, the first delivery (according to the schedule for deliveries of “AstraZeneca”) is to take place in the first quarter of next year.

On December 1, the Cabinet of Ministers considered the information report prepared by the Ministry of Health on the vaccination strategy against Covid-19.

To date, none of the vaccine manufacturers who have reported on their vaccine research have registered Covid-19 vaccines. However, the Ministry of Health and the responsible authorities are preparing for the vaccine to be registered and available. To date, the National Health Service has entered into vaccine supply agreements with four vaccine manufacturers - AstraZeneca , Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) , BioNTech / Pfizer , CureVac . The need to contract with several vaccine manufacturers is due to the fact that it is currently not possible to predict whether the registration process for all vaccines will be successful. It is also not possible to determine which vaccines will be the most effective, efficient and safe, and it is not known exactly which vaccines will be available the fastest.

The European Commission recommends that, depending on the situation in each country, priority groups for people to be vaccinated could be considered.

Vaccination against Covid-19 will be voluntary, including for healthcare professionals. Taking into account the gradual entry of vaccines into the market, the most vulnerable groups within Latvian society will be vaccinated first.

The aim is to ensure the ongoing operation of the health care system, as well as to reduce the burden of mortality and morbidity on the health care system.

The first vaccines will be given to healthcare workers working with Covid-19 patients in hospitals and to the Emergency Medical Service. Afterwards, vaccines will be provided to the following groups in this order:

    Other health care workers;
    Employees and clients of social care centres;
    People with chronic diseases;
    People over the age of 60;
    People working in operational services;
    Employees of medical institutions;
    People in places of imprisonment;
    All other residents of Latvia. It is planned that all other residents of Latvia will be able to be vaccinated starting from the second quarter of 2021.

The schedule of vaccination depends on when the registration process of vaccines will be completed and when the vaccines purchased in Latvia will be delivered. UPDATE: Whereas prior policies regarding the vaccine were for within Latvia, Today, on June 22 [2021], the Cabinet of Ministers determined the procedure for obtaining digital Covid-19 certificates in Latvia for residents who have been vaccinated abroad.

At the same time, in accordance with the recommendation of the National Council for Immunization, changes have been made to the vaccination manual, which allows the use of a different technology or so-called heterologous vaccination for primary immunization against Covid-19.

To date, none of the vaccine manufacturers who have reported on their vaccine research have registered Covid-19 vaccines. However, the Ministry of Health and the responsible authorities are preparing for the vaccine to be registered and available. To date, the National Health Service has entered into vaccine supply agreements with four vaccine manufacturers - AstraZeneca , Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) , BioNTech / Pfizer , CureVac . The need to contract with several vaccine manufacturers is due to the fact that it is currently not possible to predict whether the registration process for all vaccines will be successful. It is also not possible to determine which vaccines will be the most effective, efficient and safe, and it is not known exactly which vaccines will be available the fastest. The volume of vaccines offered by the four vaccine manufacturers could provide an opportunity to vaccinate approximately one million Latvians.

The European Commission recommends that, depending on the situation in each country, priority groups for people to be vaccinated could be considered. Consequently, the Ministry of Health has determined that the vaccines would be given first to health care workers, then to social care center clients and staff, and then to people over the age of 60, people with chronic illnesses, emergency department staff and educational staff.

Vaccines contain substances, or agents, that stimulate the body’s immunity. There are different types of vaccines. Some vaccines contain weakened or killed versions of certain viruses, bacteria, or their parts. Other vaccines contain a messenger (meaning that it merely holds information about the virus and is not the virus itself, so it cannot cause the disease or make it worse if you already have it). When a person is given the vaccine, the body’s immune system makes antibodies. When a person is exposed to a real infectious virus or bacterium, their immune system remembers it. It activates specific antibodies that have already been made, kills the virus or bacteria, and does not make you sick.
How is a vaccine developed and registered?
In order to be used in the European Union, a vaccine must meet the same standards of proof of safety, quality, and effectiveness as any other medicine. No exceptions from these essential requirements are made. More than 200 Covid-19 vaccines are currently being developed worldwide, but some are already close to the final stage.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the first to complete this registration process. The next known vaccines that are coming close to the final stage, at which the European Medicines Agency can decide on their registration, are those developed by AstraZeneca and Moderna.

The process of developing and registering these vaccines is faster than for other vaccines, due to the investment and pooling of",2020-12-28,2020-12-28,2020-12-29,The policy is a one-time measure (e.g. publication of guidelines),Latvia,LVA,LV,National,1,,,,Public Awareness Measures,Disseminating information related to COVID-19 to the public that is reliable and factually accurate,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Latvia,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),No special population targeted,,,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health",56.76452793262,53.4027165329683,49.9689242348733,47,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2zf2vZeXnB0zp7t,http://web.archive.org/web/20210111233236/https://covid19.gov.lv/en/vaccine,2021-11-30,2021-11-30T14:59:01Z

It is planned to vaccinate up to 70% of the Latvian population by the end of the summer, according to the informative report of the Ministry of Health ""On the Covid-19 vaccination plan"", which was heard today by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Minister of Health Daniels Pavļuts: “The vaccination plan we approved in government today is detailed, digital and flexible. Uncertainty is the only certainty of the time, now we will be ready to act in different situations. Both when there is a delay in the supply of vaccines and when there are a lot of them. ”

The updated vaccination plan is designed to make optimal use of the resources of the vaccination system and to implement a convenient and flexible vaccination process. The plan sets out a number of basic principles:

    the establishment of common lists of vaccinees, which will make it possible to maintain contact between those who have expressed an interest in vaccination and the location of the population in the priority group, as well as vaccination sites,
    the creation of a common calendar and queue to help plan the workload and opening hours of vaccination points and the management of records,
    centralized supply of vaccines and stockpile management,
    unified communication with the population.

This weekend, in seven Latvian cities - Riga, Daugavpils, Liepaja, Rezekne, Jelgava, Jurmala and Cesis, everyone who wants it will have the opportunity to get vaccinated. Vaccination will be carried out with the manufacturer's AstraZeneca vaccines, and the public will be able to receive the vaccine on arrival at large-scale vaccination centers in the city.

Citizens who belong to one of the already opened priority groups will be invited to a special line for them, no additional proof of compliance with the priority group will be required. A special line at the specific location will allow you to receive the vaccine more quickly than other people who want to be vaccinated. Other people who want to be vaccinated will be directed to the second line. Vaccinations will have a pre-determined amount of vaccine in each city. Once the vaccines have been used up, the vaccination center will close on that day.

Vaccination in these cities will take place from 9:00 to 17:00 (Kipsala Hall in Riga and GORS in Rezekne until 19:00) according to the following plan:",2021-04-16,2021-04-16,2021-04-18,The policy has a clear end date,Latvia,LVA,LV,National,1,,,,Public Awareness Measures,Disseminating information related to COVID-19 to the public that is reliable and factually accurate,,"",,,,,,"","","","","","","","","","","",,,,"",Yes,Latvia,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),No special population targeted,,,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health,Provincial/State Government,Municipal Government",,,,,https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2V8cy8uMaHw3J3R,https://covid19.gov.lv/aktualites/16-18-aprili-septinu-pilsetu-lielajos-vakcinacijas-centros-ar-astrazeneca-vares,2021-12-07,2021-12-07T15:08:46Z

With the reopening of some of Latvias treatments, the government has enlisted a new set of public guidelines for healthcare professionals.

At the same time, medical institutions must take a number of precautions. They will be able to provide these health care services from 9:00 to 16:00, providing a flow of individual patients. It will also be necessary to limit the number of patients staying on the premises of the treatment facility at the same time and to set a precise time of arrival for the healthcare.

Medical facilities will require both physicians and patients to provide personal protective equipment, and disinfection should be performed after each patient visit.
