2. In the configuration of the musical or choir performance area, the minimum separation will be 1.5 meters between any of its members, as well as between performers and other people.

4. Personal furniture (chairs, attics) must be cleaned and disinfected before and after use.
5. In instruments that are usually shared (percussion, pianos and others), their use must be programmed to proceed with meticulous cleaning, before and after each change of musical performer.

The new measures entail restricting movement in municipalities with a population of 100,000 or more that meet three criteria: a 14-day cumulative incidence of coronavirus cases exceeding 500 per 100,000 inhabitants, at least 10% of PCR tests coming back positive, and more than 35% of intensive care unit (ICU) beds taken up by Covid-19 patients.
