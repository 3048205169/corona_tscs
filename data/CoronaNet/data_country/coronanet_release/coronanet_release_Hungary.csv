The National Government declares that Hungarian citizens and family members of Hungarian citizens who are not Hungarian citizens entering Hungary from abroad have to undergo a medical examination upon entry. Depending on the results of the medical examination, these individuals shall be quarantined differently, as per § 2, section 2 and § 3 of Government Decree 408/2020. Non-Hungarian citizens may not enter the territory of Hungary. However, various exceptions exist. Those who may be exempted for reasons such as attendance at family events have to undergo an application procedure where they can prove their purpose of entry. Those submitting an immunity certificate upon arrival can enter Hungary without any restrictions. Individuals under the age of eighteen crossing the border alongside those with an immunity certificate can also enter Hungary without restrictions. Hungary now unilaterally recognises immunity certificates issued by certain countries.
