According to him, the decision was made taking into account the appeals and questions of citizens. Boronov noted that the government advises Kyrgyzstanis to travel on vacation in private cars, rather than in buses and minibusses, since when 50 or more citizens gather in transport, there is a risk of contracting coronavirus. “If you decide to go by bus in an organized manner, then you must comply with all sanitary standards when you are in public transport,” explained Boronov.
