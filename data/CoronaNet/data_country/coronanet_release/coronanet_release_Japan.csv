According to the UK government’s assessment, the new variant in the UK may be up to 1.7 times more infectious than the one we have been battling until now. Some experts point out that in the UK, many versions of novel corona viruses have been replaced by this new variant. Second is on the effectiveness of vaccines. At this point in time, as far as we know, there is no evidence showing that the vaccines currently being given overseas do not work on the new variant. Third, preventive measures against infection remain fundamentally the same as the ones we have been using until now.
