A targeted COVID-19 vaccine rollout over next 3-4 months will start to reach 2 million people in most at risk groups.
The plan prioritises people most at risk of harm if they get the virus and those who live and work in places where they are most likely to pick up COVID-19.
Those in South Auckland who’re over 65 or who have underlying health issues to start being vaccinated from the end of March.
