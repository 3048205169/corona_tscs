UPDATE ON PRISONER PARDON BY PRESIDENT BARROW

The number of prisoners pardoned by H.E. President Adama Barrow increased to 121 from 115

 
As part of measures to curb COVID-19 and decongest prisons, His Excellency President Adama Barrow, in exercise of his Prerogative of Mercy, has immediately pardoned some prisoners.

Seventy eight (78) of those inmates are from the Mile 2 Central Prison in Banjul, twenty four (24) from Jeshwang prison within the Kanifing Municipality and thirteen (13) from Janjangbureh Prison in the Central River Region (CRR).


Ever since his coming to power in January 2017, President Barrow has consistently granted amnesty to prisoners. Soon after assuming office Barrow in a magnanimous gesture emptied Mile Prisons of all political detainees and prisoners some of whom were languishing behind the prison walls for decades without court appearance.

In the same spirit of caring for Gambians at home and abroad as well as non-Gambians resident in the country, President Barrow will unveil more COVID-19 relief programmes for citizens of The Gambia this weekend onwards.
