The infected patients’ general practitioner will already ask them whether they have been in close contact with certain people, such as people living in the same household. In this case, the general practitioner can issue a quarantine certificate for these people, even if the individuals concerned do not (yet) show symptoms and are fit for work.

Companies - regardless of size - are obliged to organize teleworking for every function where this is possible, without exception.
For those for whom this organization is not possible, social distancing will be strictly respected. This rule applies to both the performance of the work and the transport organized by the employer. If it is impossible for companies to meet these obligations, they must close their doors.
If the authorities establish that the social distancing measures are not being complied with, the company will in the first instance be fined a heavy one; in case of non-compliance after the sanction, the company will have to close.

R_3n61LQE1lXuYptiAmDi,7602025AmDi,new_entry,original,,,"On Tuesday 17 March, the National Security Council, which has been expanded to include the Ministers-President, decided to take additional measures. On the one hand, these measures are based on the evolution of the spread of Covid-19 in Belgium.
Companies - regardless of size - are obliged to organize teleworking for every function where this is possible, without exception.
For those for whom this organization is not possible, social distancing will be strictly respected. This rule applies to both the performance of the work and the transport organized by the employer. If it is impossible for companies to meet these obligations, they must close their doors.
If the authorities establish that the social distancing measures are not being complied with, the company will in the first instance be fined a heavy one; in case of non-compliance after the sanction, the company will have to close.

The measures set out below will enter into force at noon on Wednesday 18 March and shall be maintained until 5 April. The situation will continue to be assessed on a daily basis and further changes may be made as the situation evolves.
